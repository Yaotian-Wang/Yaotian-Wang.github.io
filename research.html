				<p><font size="+2"><b>Clusters of regions showing identical lifespan functional connectivity trajectories</b></font></p>
				<p>Regions within the same cluster exhibit identical patterns of age-related functional connectivity (FC) changes. 
					Regions with identical FC trajectories generally have the same functions. 
					Yet, regions with the same function may have distinct FC trajectories, as evidenced by clustering results showing that large functional networks are typically divided into smaller region clusters. 
					Here, within each functional network, region clusters are shown in different colors and labeled (e.g., a, b, etc.) in descending order according to their number of regions, from the largest to the smallest.

					The diamond at electrode G37 is the SOZ identified by expert interpretation of EEG data. Nodes in light blue are the regions that did not belong to any clusters. Nodes in the same other colors (either dark blue, green, pink, red, purple, orange or yellow) denote different identified clusters of regions. All nodes in red color belong to the SOZ cluster. Grey arrows indicate the identified directed connections between regions. Anteroinferior electrodes preceded by an “X” were resected in a previous epilepsy surgery.

				<p>The nodes in the same color are identified to be in the same module. Black edges represent directed connections between modules that have distinct functions. The directed connections selected have top 1% posterior probabilities. Our method revealed several smaller modules in large functional brain systems, such as the visual and the default mode system. We also discovered that the strongest between-module directed connections are between the auditory and somatosensory-motor modules and between the cingulo-opercular task control and salience modules.</p>
